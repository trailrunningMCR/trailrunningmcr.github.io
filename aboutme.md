TrailRunningMCR offer guided runs along trail or fell on the edge of the beautiful Peak District, on the outskirsts of Greater Manchester.

Based in Marple Bridge, easily accessible by train (Marple station) or car, we have a variety of routes through the countryside taking in the heights, woodlands, farmland and waterways.



Established routes:
- Manchester Sunset (approx. 15Km)

(A steady climb lets us take in **the best** view of Manchester at sunset atop this challenging route, before a thrilling downhill winding through the woods back to Marple station.
