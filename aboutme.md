TrailRunningMCR offer guided runs along trail or fell on the edge of the beautiful Peak District.
Based in Marple Bridge, easily accessible by train (Marple station) or car, we have a variety of routes through the countryside taking in the heights, woodlands, farmland and waterways.

Established routes:
- Manchester Sunset (approx. 15Km)
(A steady climb lets us take in **the best** view of Manchester at sunset atop this challenging route, before a thrilling downhill winding through the woods back to Marple station.
